# Feature_extraction
A system for obtaining optical and radio morphology classes in astronomical image data in the form of a folder of images (Or classes in any image dataset). The representation learning relies on ImageNet weights as well fine-tunning using the self supervised learning algorithm BYOL. The representation can be extracted, clustered and visualized using sci-kit learn based clustering algorithms and manifold learning algorithms such as UMAP, PaCMAP and t-SNE.
